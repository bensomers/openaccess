Goals for dev cycle 3:

More robust user/admin levels
Blog comments (probably anonymous, if there's a spam comment problem, then I'll require registration)
Blog RSS?
AJAX in relevant places
general CSS & styling improvements (find a designer to help?)
Fix the stupid graph image bug (with divs?)
Heroku deployment?
Capistrano?
Once I've got domain stuff worked out, ask Peter Suber & the OA Week people to re-link us
Add an about OA page (Green OA vs. Gold OA)
Add a contact us page
add extract/load fixtures?  It's better than yaml_db any day
write tests!
do cross-browser (*cough* IE) testing
add a textile markup toolbar plugin (Maaaybe TEH...maybe learn how to use MarkItUp?)
