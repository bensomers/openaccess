<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why do you publish your research?
</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  If I am funded to do research, then it is my obligation to make the results
available to the community.  Why light a candle and hide it under a bucket?
</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How do you choose where (in which journals) to publish your articles?
</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  I choose the journal most appropriate for the research, i.e. one that publishes
research in my field.
</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Are you familiar with the concept of Open Access?  Are you  familiar
    with University Open Access programs?
</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  No.


<p>
<em>
For the rest of the questions, Open Access articles are defined as:
<p>
<em>1. Available to any reader to freely license or copy and to redistribute the article without limitations</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>2. Available in an online repository that is free for anyone to access</em>
</p>
</em>
</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What are your experiences involving OA?  (Have you ever published
    material under OA?)
</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  No.
</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What is the state of Open Access at Yale as far as you know?  Have you
    ever published something in an open access journal?
</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Probably not.
</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How would you feel about expanding the state of open access at  Yale?
    What about requiring it?
</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  I have no problems with open access, but I can imagine some problems with
maintaining quality control, i.e. having all articles refereed.
</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Would you consider publishing some of your future work OA?  What  kind
    of incentive would you need to publish in one?
</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  I will continue to publish in the journal most appropriate for my research.
</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What are your concerns (or your peers' concerns) about an OA  program?
</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Maintaining quality control and responsible refereeing.
</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When you use/reference articles by other academics/your peers,  do you
    ever access/use OA journals?
</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  I do not know.
</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do you consider whether a journal is OA when looking for reference
    materials?
</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  No.
