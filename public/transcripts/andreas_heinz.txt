<strong>Q:</strong>  How do you choose where (in which journals) to publish your articles?
</p>

<p>
<strong>A:</strong>  Standard for me are APS journals but in general I try to be diverse in the
journals I submit articles to in order to ensure that the number of journals
in my field does not decrease. Prestige does play a role. At the end of the
day the prestige of the journal is important, too. Those are the journals
which my colleagues are reading. Publishing in prestigious journals is also
important to my funding agencies and for promotions.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q:</strong>  Are you familiar with the concept of Open Access?  Are you familiar with University Open Access programs?
</p>

<p>
<strong>A:</strong>  Quite frankly: I do know arXiv.org, a preprint server which is widely used
in physics, but nothing about open access at Yale.
</p>

<p><em>Disussion about the concept of open access.  For the rest of the 
questions, Open Access articles are defined as:
1.  Available to any reader to freely license or copy and to redistribute
the article without limitations
2.  Available in an online repository that is free for anyone to access
</em
</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What are your experiences involving OA?  (Have you ever published
material
under OA?)
</p>

<p>
<strong>A:</strong>  Some of my articles are available on arXiv.org, but I do not publish there
on a regular basis.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q:</strong>  What is the state of Open Access at Yale as far as you know? Have you
ever published something in an open access journal?
</p>

<p>
<strong>A:</strong>  I don't know about the status of Open Access at Yale. I never published in
an open access journal other than arXiv.org.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q:</strong>  How would you feel about expanding the state of open access at Yale?
What about requiring it?
</p>

<p>
<strong>A:</strong>  From a scientific point of view I like the idea of being able to address
also readers which cannot afford to subscribe to the journals I am
publishing in. However, I am a strong supporter of the peer-review system.
Without such a system, articles in an open access journal will not have the
impact of traditional journals. Funding agencies will, as far as I can tell,
still require that scientific results are published in high-impact journals.
This might be a problem if Yale would want to require open-access
publications.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q:</strong>  Would you consider publishing some of your future work OA?  What kind of incentive would you need to publish in one?
</p>

<p>
<strong>A:</strong>  I would need the support by the university/department and my funding
agencies and the knowledge that the OA journal is read by colleagues on a
regular basis. It would need to be peer-reviewed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q:</strong>  What are your concerns (or your peers' concerns) about an OA program?
</p>

<p>
<strong>A:</strong>  Lack of peer-review and impact, i.e. number of readers in my field of
research.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Q:</strong>  When you use/reference articles by other academics/your peers, do you ever access/use OA journals?
</p>

<p>
<strong>A:</strong>  Rarely.
</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do you consider whether a journal is OA when looking for reference
materials?
</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not at this point - arXiv - is not a peer-reviewed journal.</p>
