Title: Woolsey Professor of Religious Studies, Yale University


*Q:* Why do you publish?

*A:* Because I like to. It’s fun. I think I got into this field originally…I actually used to be a musician. But I liked teaching so I thought that I liked this religious studies stuff so maybe I should try to get a degree, but the only place that you can teach that much is at universities on the east coast. I’d have to get a Ph.D., so I went into grad school pretty much with the idea that I would teach and I had to have a PhD to teach and once you’re in an academic situation, you have to publish. You know, “Publish or Perish.” I thought I’d be doing the research more to support myself than teaching, but it actually flipped. After, especially even in grad school, I started realizing that I really liked the research. Then, writing my dissertation, I found that I really liked writing this big project. The more I did that, the more I’ve actually found that I like teaching OK, but, y’know, if someone offered me a job tomorrow at the Princeton Center for Advanced Studies, for example, where I didn’t have to teach, or especially be on committees *blech!* and I could just research and write all the time, I think I’d take them up on it at this point in my life. Unfortunately, no one offers you those kinds of jobs unless you’re a scientist. So, I think the first thing is that’s what I like to do: coming up with a problem and trying to solve the problem: reading a lot of stuff and searching through libraries and trying to figure out a coherent argument. I’ve also found that I like the challenge of trying to write it well so that it’s accessible to audiences. Clearly also, especially some things that I’ve written which are intended for a wider audience, like the Sex and the Single Savior book or my Pedagogy of the Bible…those were because I want to change the world. The Sex and the Single Savior books were because I really don’t like the way the Bible engages in discussions about gender and sexuality. The pedagogy was because I think that people who are being trained for the ministry aren’t being trained properly. I thought that I had better ideas about this, so I’ll try to change the tools. So, there is a part of wanting to get things out there. Also, I guess it’s the fact that I’m egotistical and the way you get out there and get respect as a scholar is publishing. If you don’t publish, no one gets it. Now, talking about open access, I’ve never been too worried about…because I haven’t geared my writing/publishing to making money, like some of my friends had. Bart Ehrman is making a ton of money…he was just actually talking to me about it. There was this guy visiting a class a week ago or so and he was taking pictures and notes and he was a representative of one of those companies that videotapes professors and sells the tapes or discs or whatever and my friend Bart has done those. I said “I don’t know why I’d be interested because the lectures that I had for Yale..they’re gonna put those online for me. I don’t know why some company would go and invest a bunch of money in those. I don’t want to sit down and write a bunch of new lectures for this course; I don’t really want to do that.” He wrote back and said “Well, I’ve done one of those and I make between 50 and 60 thousand dollars a year doing that.” He said “You might consider doing that.” Of course, his latest book has been on the bestseller book for weeks. He’ll say “Why don’t you write a popular book? Do it with my publisher! ” But, I just can’t stand the thought of it. When I write stuff, I’m interested in WHAT I’m writing. I’m interested in getting the ideas out there. Just writing to sell…it just doesn’t appeal to me. So, what that means is that some people would not want their lectures put online for free because they feel it’s their property and they’re going to make money off of it some way. Or you know they’ll actually write to make money. Since I don’t do that, I’ve never been concerned with people putting my books or my articles or things online so that anybody could use that for free. I’m more concerned with getting my ideas out there than making money.

*A:* When you publish articles, how do you choose where to publish them?

*Q:* It depends a lot upon what the content of the article is and what I want to accomplish with it. I'm writing an article right now that is very focused on the question "What are Angels and Demons in ancient Judaism and when did Angels become Demons?" In ancient Christianity mythology, demons are fallen angels. This doesn't agree with Paul or with ancient Judaism, so I've been trying to figure out what's going on here. As in, when does this happen. Paul doesn't believe this, that demons are one kind of being and angels are another kind of being and they don't really cross paths much. When do they come together? I decided it was around the 2nd-3rd century in Christian mythology. I've done a bunch of presentations on this at various conferences and schools, and it involves comparing the translations of the Hebrew bible to the translations in the Greek or the Septuagint version. It's very technical. I'll probably send that to the Journal of Biblical literature, which is pretty much the flagship journal of biblical studies, probably internationally. Certainly in North America. That's because it's going to be a technical thing. I've published articles in more popular...well...maybe not "popular." I had a piece that was invited...a lot of times when I publish articles it's because I'm invited to and people want me writing them for a series or a collection they're editing and publishing so it gets published like that. For example, the Anglican Theological review asked me to write a short essay on homosexuality in the bible for a collection of unpublished essays from this dead professor.

*Q:* Are you familiar with research repositories?

*A:* You mean online?...[discussion of repositories]...Oh. I've heard of that. There are a lot of professors opposed to that.

I can see that people might have legitimate objections if it's a situation where it's depriving them of the opportunity to make money. For example, I know that there are scientists who are very opposed...there are some schools who force their scientists to co-ownership of patents and things like that. I can see why scientists would balk at things like that. Like I said, I've never made much money at all from all of my royalties. I've published five books of my own where I was the sole author and I've edited like three with other people, and per year, all I make on all the royalties on all the books...the most I've ever made was last year...$4,000 total. For years, I'd get maybe $600 total. That's what's more normal, especially for scholars in the humanities. You just don't get much, unless you publish really popular stuff. Unless it's the New York Times bestseller list or something, you really don't make much money. Literature, Religion, Classics, these subjects..more people buy our stuff because it has an audience of seminaries, divinity schools, churches. So, I'm always surprised when someone who publishes in Art History tells me what they make on royalties or even the number of books printed. It might only be 1,500 or 750 printed in the first printing, which for most books is the only one. I always thought that I sold very few but they come around in about 3,000 books per printing. A lot of people who are buying my books would't go out and buy an art history book. Most of us just think that we're not making that much money on books anyway.

*Q:* What if faculty were able to opt out of inclusion in a repository?

*A:* I think that if I had that option..hm..well, when people ask me if they can put up my talks online and let people see the written transcript, I always tell them yes.

*Q:* Are there OA journals focusing in religious studies?

*A:* I can't imagine that there wouldn't be. My grad students would know.

*Q:* How would you feel about an OA program at Yale?

*A:* I'd have no problem with it. I think the only people who might have a problem with it are those who stand to make a lot of money off of their work. Especially articles...I don't ever make any money off of articles!

*Q:* Have you heard of the overpricetag project?

*A:* That's the way they make their money...individuals used to subscribe to journals, but nowadays publishers rely on journals. They used to have an individual/library price for journals. Libraries went along with it for years because for a number of years, having those journals on hand was one of the only ways to maintain your reputation as a top research library. Now, libraries have stopped doing it...
