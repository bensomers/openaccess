*Q:* Why do you publish your research?

*A:* If I am funded to do research, then it is my obligation to make the results available to the community. Why light a candle and hide it under a bucket?

*Q:* How do you choose where (in which journals) to publish your articles?

*A:* I choose the journal most appropriate for the research, i.e. one that publishes research in my field.

*Q:* Are you familiar with the concept of Open Access? Are you familiar with University Open Access programs?

*A:* No.

_For the rest of the questions, Open Access articles are defined as:_

_1. Available to any reader to freely license or copy and to redistribute the article without limitations_

_2. Available in an online repository that is free for anyone to access_

*Q:* What are your experiences involving OA? (Have you ever published material under OA?)

*A:* No.

*Q:* What is the state of Open Access at Yale as far as you know? Have you ever published something in an open access journal?

*A:* Probably not.

*Q:* How would you feel about expanding the state of open access at Yale? What about requiring it?

*A:* I have no problems with open access, but I can imagine some problems with maintaining quality control, i.e. having all articles refereed.

*Q:* Would you consider publishing some of your future work OA? What kind of incentive would you need to publish in one?

*A:* I will continue to publish in the journal most appropriate for my research.

*Q:* What are your concerns (or your peers' concerns) about an OA program?

*A:* Maintaining quality control and responsible refereeing.

*Q:* When you use/reference articles by other academics/your peers, do you ever access/use OA journals?

*A:* I do not know.

*Q:* Do you consider whether a journal is OA when looking for reference materials?

*A:* No.
