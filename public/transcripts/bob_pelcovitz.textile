*Q:* How do you choose where (in which journals) to publish your articles?

*A:* Based on the prestige of the journal and the likelihood that my article will be read by people in the field.

*Q:* Are you familiar with the concept of Open Access? Are you familiar with University Open Access programs?

*A:* Not really, but sounds vaguely familiar.

_Omitted: a brief discussion about the concept of open access. For the rest of the questions, Open Access articles are defined as:_

_1. Available to any reader to freely license or copy and to redistribute the article without limitations_

_2. Available in an online repository that is free for anyone to access_

*Q:* What are your experiences involving OA? (Have you ever published material under OA?)

*A:* When submitting to a regular journal I also submit to arXiv, the physics repository and granddad of OA.

*Q:* What is the state of Open Access at Brown as far as you know? Have you ever published something in an open access journal?

*A:* No, I have not.

*Q:* How would you feel about expanding the state of open access at Brown? What about requiring it?

*A:* I would not require it.

*Q:* Would you consider publishing some of your future work OA? What kind of incentive would you need to publish in one?

*A:* If my field (condensed matter physics) became like high energy physics where people are comfortable posting to arXiv and not publishing otherwise, I would publish in OA, but it would have to be an OA that became the norm of my field.

*Q:* What are your concerns (or your peers' concerns) about an OA program?

*A:* Is it refereed like regular publications?

*Q:* When you use/reference articles by other academics/your peers, do you ever access/use OA journals?

*A:* Not typically.

*Q:* Do you consider whether a journal is OA when looking for reference materials?

*A:* No.
