<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How long have you been publishing?
</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Since 1969

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do you feel like the environment has changed a lot since then when it comes to journal articles?


Yeah, the stakes are vastly higher now. The amount of work that gets put into each paper, at least in a leading journal is amazingly greater than it was in 1969. There's just so much you can learn so fast these days... things are moving so quickly that each article is a monumental piece of work. It's amazing. And many articles have lots of additional material that doesn't appear in the main part of the article; it goes into supplemental materials. They can frequently be five times as long as the main article and contain vast amounts of data that's in public databases and so on. Anyway, things have changed quite a bit. And this is in biological sciences. You should understand that the publishing habits have been different, and different parts of the academy vary tremendously. In biology, everybody's in a big rush, so there's a huge premium on getting your paper out first and getting your paper reviewed and edited and so on very quickly. In other fields, like philosophy, it might take years to get a paper reviewed and published... history, and other fields like that. So biology is operating on a different time scale than some other fields. And the volume of publications is phenomenally larger than in some other fields. Then there are other fields that move even faster, like physics, because they post a lot of their work as preprints on servers, so anybody can take a look at that before it's even reviewed or published in a journal. So that's often another extreme. So the philosophers are here, the physicists are here, and the biologists are somewhere in the middle. Okay?

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why do you publish your research?

Why do we publish our research? Because that's the public record of what we've discovered and the currency for professional advancement and obtaining research funds because it's very expensive. To run my lab costs about over a million dollars a year... something like that. There are six or seven graduate students... six or seven post-docs... some undergrads, technicians, and so on. It's like running a small business; that's all funded by public funds. You have to have a record of accomplishment to justify somebody giving you that kind of money every year. And the publications are the public record.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So how do you choose which publications to publish in?

That depends on the particular paper. Some papers are of greater general interest than others. And for papers that might have a wide audience, then you'd like to publish them in a journal that has a wide audience too. So some journals, like Science, where you read our paper, has two-hundred thousand subscribers, or something like that vast number... maybe it's one-hundred-fifty thousand; I can't remember. Some other journals may have no subscribers, other than libraries. So it's a huge difference in the number of people who will see a particular paper. And so, for something of general interest, like the paper you read, which was bringing together lots of biochemistry and cell biology and mathematical modeling... you know, something like that's considered to be a substantial advance in a field, and then you can compete for space in one of those high-profile journals. Now there's lots of other very good work that we publish that's progressively more specialized and so I'm pretty good about understanding ahead of time when we put a paper together where it would be appropriate to publish the work. Some people just try for the highest possible journal they could possibly get their paper in every time, and then when they get rejected there, they go and try something new that's more specialized, less competitive. I think that's a waste of time. After all these years, I pretty much know which kind of journal's going to be receptive to a particular paper and we can aim our papers to an appropriate journal.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So are you familiar with the concept of Open Access?

Oh sure. Absolutely. I'm in leadership positions in scientific societies that worry about this all the time.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do you have any experiences involving Open Access?

Oh sure, yeah. What do you want to know?

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Have you ever published any material in Open Access journals?

The journals vary in the extent to which they are open access. There are some journals, society journals, and [especially] the National Academy of Sciences, both of which I work for in an editorial capacity, who release their articles relatively soon after they've been published, after a month or so, or sometimes after a shorter delay. Then there are other journals that will release the content after a year, which is pretty much the standard these days. And it would be helpful if everybody released the content of their articles sooner than later. And Congress is interested in this, and they have passed legislation saying everybody whose work is supported by the National Institutes of Health has to put their papers when they're accepted on a website at the National Institutes of Health. And so on. So it's moving along in that direction. But the commercial publishers, and some of the scientific societies that publish journals are very nervous about open access. So let's see why they're so nervous about this. Some scientific societies' main source of revenue is the sales of their journal, and so they're concerned that if they release the content of their journal up front with no delay that they'd lose many of their individual subscribers and maybe some of their institutional subscribers and their scientific society would collapse financially. They're probably wrong, actually, because the American Society for Cell Biology, which publishes a journal called Molecular Biology of the Cell, has experimented with this, and I think (and I'm one of the editors, so I've got an interest in this) has experimented with how to maintain subscriptions and open the content to the general public, and I think we release things after two months now. And as we gradually scaled back the release date from a year to six months to two months, it actually increased the number of subscriptions. I don't know that anybody else has tried this experiment or not. I don't know what would happen had they scaled it back to zero months. But at the moment that's where that journal stands, and for virtually any purpose that I can imagine, a two month delay is not a big deal. So that's where things are going. Now there are some other journals that are completely open access and release their content immediately.  Oh, I should say, some society journals release (like the Molecular Biology of the Cell and the Journal of Biological Chemistry), actually release a PDF file of the manuscript that will be published before they're edited (after they're reviewed), they release a PDF file of the manuscript on a website during the time that the manuscript's being processed and the publication's coming out and then after two months they release the final, edited, formated, perfect paper. And so those society journals are actually completely open in that sense, that you can see the content of the article. Doesn't look as nice as the finished product where it's all perfect.  Anyway, so they're pretty much open from the beginning even though they have a two month delay from their official publication release. Okay. Then there are some journals that are completely open access that release their content right away, and their business model involves the authors paying a fairly large fee to publish the article because it actually costs money to review and edit and publish even if it's electronic papers, so it's a fairly sizable amount of money... A few thousand dollars, something like that. And, you know, that's fine. They actually need more money than the money they can collect from the authors so that the main open access journals actually have philanthropic sources of funding that are probably going to go away at some point. They were instituted just to allow the open access movement to get going and probably won't be maintained, so I don't know what's going to happen to those journals when their philanthropy goes away. So, anyway, it's virtuous to release everything right away, but actually it's financially a bit of a challenge, and for some societies, it's actually self-threatening that they don't have a very good open access policy. For the commercial publishers, they're all scared to death that they're going to lose their business and, so, they have a delay before they release their content. It turns out, if you look at the number of downloads of articles, that the peak is right at the beginning... The first week, the first month, then it gradually trails off.  And depending on the quality and interest of the article, then there's some sort of steady state number of downloads you get, and the people who are worried about their business going away take a look at those curves and say, okay, there's a high level of demand for a month or so, and so we can afford to release after two months or after a year when the demand's gone down. Because of that demand up front, they don't think they can release right away because they'll lose their paying customers.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What is the state of open access at Yale? What is the general sentiment towards it?

I'm not sure there is a Yale opinion about open access. You can ask as many faculty members as you'd like, and they'd probably all have similar but certainly not a uniform opinion about the whole thing. I don't see that many people in our department here publishing in the pure open access journals, but I'm sure that's going to change. I have two children up there in that family picture; they're both young scientists, and they almost always publish in the completely open access journals. That's just something that younger scientists think is an appropriate thing to do, and the older people have been publishing in the same journals as always; they know their readers are there, but they've got a whole new set of readers in the fields that they're in, and so they're fine. They publish in the open access journal.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How do you feel about expanding the open access policy at Yale? Something like Harvard's where all faculty members are required to grant Harvard a license that allows them to put it online in an online depository?

Well for biologists, that already happens. NIH does that already. I don't know how the people in other fields would react to that. Biologists are already used to that. Okay?

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you would be fine with something like that?

Well, I mean theoretically all the preprints go to the NIH, and actually the commercial publishers are very good about this. They know they're supposed to do this, so they actually send the preprints to the NIH. I've got four of them waiting there in line; I've got to approve their submission to the NIH. I've been too busy teaching cell biology to go to the website and say it's okay for you guys to put this thing on your website before the paper comes out. The other journals I publish in are pretty good about releasing their content right away, so, like I said, I don't think a two month delay is material, because it isn't going to change anybody's life. The work usually took years to accomplish, and it took months or years to get the paper written and published, so what's another two months before the journal releases it to the public? So, I don't think it's a big deal. It's a little deal.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do you feel like there are any benefits of open access?

Oh sure, yeah. I mean, there are plenty of places in the world where there are no libraries, and there's no way to get your hands on the literature, whether it's in science or it's in other fields, so its great for the parts of the world that don't have the university library. We're all spoiled here. We can log on to essentially anything that's published in the world from home or anywhere else on earth by just logging in through Yale. And so Yale has to pay big bucks to the publishers to have access to all those things. I don't know who [isn't able to] understand, this is actually a scary aspect of the whole thing, that those electronic files are not in the Yale library, even through we're paying money for it. Those files are someplace else, so if... Most responsible people have them very well backed up in multiple places, but if a publisher went out of business and said to hell with it, they weren't going to maintain their files, you could lose all this stuff, so the library is scared to death about this, so they actually have paper copies of all the journals because we know that'll last for hundreds of years. And it'd be different if the library actually had the digital files of all these journals, but they don't, so when you log into the library and you download a paper from Science or the New England Journal of Medicine like I did last night to do this thing for class today, the paper isn't here. The paper's in Boston or in London or someplace... the electronic files in London or Boston or someplace... it's not here. And it's just a link through to the journal server. It's prety weird. So they're paying thousands of bucks a year for access to the server and counting on somebody else to archive this stuff. That's a strange thing about electronic publishing. But anyway, that's how it goes.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What do you feel like professors here... What do you feel like their chief concern about open access is? Not the publishers, but the actual professors.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, the only concern... I don't think anybody has any concern about access to the material... the only concern that anybody has here... or at least, it seems to me... is publishing in a startup journal that doesn't have a track record. So the open access journals were invented in the past ten years, and they don't have a track record, or they're just developing a track record, and some of them are doing pretty well, some of them are not doing pretty well; whereas, something like the Journal of Cell Biology or Science or Nature... those have been around for a long time.  A hundred and fifty years in the case of Science and Nature. Decades... half a century in the case of the Journal of Cell Biology. So those are well established, prestigious places to publish work. You don't just want to publish work; you want to publish work in a high-quality journal. That doesn't mean there isn't high quality work in the not-so-good journals, but there's a lot of important prestige connected with publishing in good journals. For example, it doesn't make too much difference to me, I mean, I'm a well established person here. But for a young person like yourself, it would actually be a huge benefit for you to get a research publication in one of these top journals. That would mark you as somebody who could do that quality of work and would improve your chances of getting into medical school, if that's where you're headed, or getting into business school, if that's where you're headed, or getting into graduate school and having a faculty position, getting a grant, all those things. When people look at somebody's track record, they say, oh, look he published in this journal, in that journal, and other things... they might not know the exact details, but they'll just read down the list and see where the papers are published. And for young people like my kids, who are in their thirties, those people read down the list and they find all these open access journals and say, that's cool, this person's with it, they're publishing in open access journals. But for people who are even ten years older than them, who established themselves before the open access journals came along, they're much more reluctant to publish in those journals.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  It's the journal itself that people look at?

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yep.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Not the number of citations, or...

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, yeah, well, the number of citations go along with that. So the prestige journals all have very high citation rates.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Interesting. Do you see the future as being....


<p><strong>A:</strong>  It'll evolve. I mean, there were some journals in the biochemistry area that were prominent, favorite places to publish work forty years ago that are pretty much disappeared. They're still publishing, but it's third-rate material. So the quality of these journals is not constant over time; it can go up, or it can go down. And the top journals spent an enormous amount of time and effort making sure they stay on top. So I'm on the board of directors of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which publishes Science, which is the number one journal in the world, and they spend an enormous amount of time and effort making sure that they stay number one. It's a very competitive business. They're always looking over their shoulder at Nature, trying to stay one step ahead of them. I don't know whether this happens in the non-scientific fields, I just don't know anything about it. I have a brother who's a philosophy professor, and my impression is that in that area of academic activity it's completely different. I'm sure there's a pecking order for the journals there, but they're all small operations, and they move slowly. I'm sure it's important to the people in the field, but it's not a fifty million dollar business like Science magazine is. That little Science magazine comes out... costs a million dollars a week to produce. Ha!
