*Q:* Why do you publish your research?

*A:* Because I am a scholar, because scholarship is a collective activity with public responsibilities, because I like to share ideas.

*Q:* How do you choose where (in which journals) to publish your articles?

*A:* Journals select me as often as I selected journals, in that editors are seeking articles in special issues or seeking coverage of particular topics that happen to be those in which I am working. When I select a journal as a venue, is because I think it its readership will provide the most challenging and interested audience for my ideas. My choice does not depend on my calculation of the Journal's access.

*Q:* Are you familiar with the concept of Open Access? Are you familiar with University Open Access programs?

*A:* I am familiar with the concept, and I know that the University has encouraged it through various programs. However, I do not know the details of the university programs.

_For the rest of the questions, Open Access articles are defined as:_

_1. Available to any reader to freely license or copy and to redistribute the article without limitations_

_2. Available in an online repository that is free for anyone to access_

*Q:* What are your experiences involving OA? (Have you ever published material under OA?)

*A:* I maintain and offer PDF copies of every book, article, and review I have written at my personal Yale website. All of my courses have websites that are open to the world, with only copyrighted material of others (readings, images, streaming video) limited to Yale students in courses. I realize that in some cases my legal authority to do so is shaky and may be challenged, but so far I have never been questioned or forced to take down any of my publications.

*Q:* What is the state of Open Access at Yale as far as you know? Have you ever published something in an open access journal?

*A:* I don't know if the journals I have published in are formally open access, but many are available online for free through JSTOR.

*Q:* How would you feel about expanding the state of open access at Yale? What about requiring it?

*A:* In principle, I think it is a good idea. I'm not sure if it should be required for all disciplines and all scholars

*Q:* Would you consider publishing some of your future work OA? What kind of incentive would you need to publish in one?

*A:* I don't publish for money so the issue of royalties is not important to me personally. I am concerned about intellectual property rights, especially for junior scholars, and I am not persuaded that Creative Commons License offers much protection.

*Q:* When you use/reference articles by other academics/your peers, do you ever access/use OA journals?

*A:* Yes.

*Q:* Do you consider whether a journal is OA when looking for reference materials?

*A:* No.
