*Q:* Why do you publish your research?

*A:* Communicating with others is essential to the pursuit of truth. You have to allow your convictions to be challenged or confirmed by others, who are in a position to do so. (Many responses to my work have no interested me at all. ) There was the other and more prosaic reason: to make your way in academe you need to publish. That is no longer a matter of personal concern.

*Q:* How do you choose where (in which journals) to publish your articles?

*A:* I have not given the matter much thought. In the beginning of my career I tried to pick journals that seemed appropriate for a particular piece I had written. But I never allowed the preferences of particular journals or the then current academic fashion to dictate the direction of my work. In the last thirty years or so I have not published unsolicited pieces, except for my books.

*Q:* Q. Are you familiar with the concept of Open Access? Are you familiar with University Open Access programs?

*A:* Only vaguely. I think I am for it. The more open access, the better. I was thus pleased when the first third of a book I had written was put on the internet by someone in Israel, and without my permission; or when my book, The Meaning of Modern Art was published in a Korean translation, once again without my knowledge.

For the rest of the questions, Open Access articles are defined as:

1. Available to any reader to freely license or copy and to redistribute the article without limitations

2. Available in an online repository that is free for anyone to access

*Q:* What are your experiences involving OA? (Have you ever published material under OA?)

No.

*Q:* What is the state of Open Access at Yale as far as you know? Have you ever published something in an open access journal?

*A:* I have not paid attention to it.

*Q:* How would you feel about expanding the state of open access at Yale? What about requiring it?

*A:* As I said before, the more open access, the better. But I would be against requiring it. There may well be good reasons why a certain essay should not be available to everyone -- although this is less likely to be the case in philosophy than in some other areas.

*Q:* Would you consider publishing some of your future work OA? What kind of incentive would you need to publish in one?

*A:* Since I believe that open access is a good idea, I would not need any special incentive, as long as I was sure that whatever essay or book was made available in that manner, was made available in a form that did justice to it. That can become especially important where there is a question of using visual material. That may, e. g., involve issues of quality of image and of copyright laws. A publisher, too, may insist on restrictions - and I still much prefer to read a book I can hold in my hand. In my case royalties have not been a very significant factor.

*Q:* What are your concerns (or your peers' concerns) about an OA program?

*A:* I have not really discussed it with anyone in any substantial way. What comment I have heard has been in favor of open access.

*Q:* When you use/reference articles by other academics/your peers, do you ever access/use OA journals?

*A:* I certainly have made references to material, including articles, I found on the internet, but I have paid no attention to whether something was published in an OA journal.

*Q:* Do you consider whether a journal is OA when looking for reference materials?

*A:* No
