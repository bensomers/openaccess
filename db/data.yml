      *Q:* How do you choose where (in which journals) to publish your articles?
      
      *A:* Standard for me are APS journals but in general I try to be diverse in the journals I submit articles to in order to ensure that the number of journals in my field does not decrease. Prestige does play a role. At the end of the day the prestige of the journal is important, too. Those are the journals which my colleagues are reading. Publishing in prestigious journals is also important to my funding agencies and for promotions.
      
      *Q:* Are you familiar with the concept of Open Access? Are you familiar with University Open Access programs?
      
      *A:* Quite frankly: I do know arXiv.org, a preprint server which is widely used in physics, but nothing about open access at Yale.
      
      _Discussion about the concept of open access. For the rest of the questions, Open Access articles are defined as: 1. Available to any reader to freely license or copy and to redistribute the article without limitations 2. Available in an online repository that is free for anyone to access_
      
      *Q:* What are your experiences involving OA? (Have you ever published material under OA?)
      
      *A:* Some of my articles are available on arXiv.org, but I do not publish there on a regular basis.
      
      *Q:* What is the state of Open Access at Yale as far as you know? Have you ever published something in an open access journal?
      
      *A:* I don't know about the status of Open Access at Yale. I never published in an open access journal other than arXiv.org.
      
      *Q:* How would you feel about expanding the state of open access at Yale? What about requiring it?
      
      *A:* From a scientific point of view I like the idea of being able to address also readers which cannot afford to subscribe to the journals I am publishing in. However, I am a strong supporter of the peer-review system. Without such a system, articles in an open access journal will not have the impact of traditional journals. Funding agencies will, as far as I can tell, still require that scientific results are published in high-impact journals. This might be a problem if Yale would want to require open-access publications.

      *Q:* How would you feel about expanding the state of open access at Yale? What about requiring it?
      
      *Q:* Would you consider publishing some of your future work OA? What kind of incentive would you need to publish in one?
      
      *A:* I would need the support by the university/department and my funding agencies and the knowledge that the OA journal is read by colleagues on a regular basis. It would need to be peer-reviewed.
      
      *Q:* What are your concerns (or your peers' concerns) about an OA program?
      
      *A:* Lack of peer-review and impact, i.e. number of readers in my field of research.
      
      *Q:* When you use/reference articles by other academics/your peers, do you ever access/use OA journals?
      
      *A:* Rarely.
      
      *Q:* Do you consider whether a journal is OA when looking for reference materials?
      
      *A:* Not at this point - arXiv - is not a peer-reviewed journal.

      *Q:* How do you choose where (in which journals) to publish your articles?
      
      *A:* Based on the prestige of the journal and the likelihood that my article will be read by people in the field.
      
      *Q:* Are you familiar with the concept of Open Access? Are you familiar with University Open Access programs?
      
      *A:* Not really, but sounds vaguely familiar.
      
      _Omitted: a brief discussion about the concept of open access. For the rest of the questions, Open Access articles are defined as:_
      
      _1. Available to any reader to freely license or copy and to redistribute the article without limitations_
      
      _2. Available in an online repository that is free for anyone to access_
      
      *Q:* What are your experiences involving OA? (Have you ever published material under OA?)
      
      *A:* When submitting to a regular journal I also submit to arXiv, the physics repository and granddad of OA.
      
      *Q:* What is the state of Open Access at Brown as far as you know? Have you ever published something in an open access journal?
      
      *A:* No, I have not.
      
      *Q:* How would you feel about expanding the state of open access at Brown? What about requiring it?
      
      *A:* I would not require it.
      
      *Q:* Would you consider publishing some of your future work OA? What kind of incentive would you need to publish in one?
      
      *A:* If my field (condensed matter physics) became like high energy physics where people are comfortable posting to arXiv and not publishing otherwise, I would publish in OA, but it would have to be an OA that became the norm of my field.
      
      *Q:* What are your concerns (or your peers' concerns) about an OA program?
      
      *A:* Is it refereed like regular publications?
      
      *Q:* When you use/reference articles by other academics/your peers, do you ever access/use OA journals?
      
      *A:* Not typically.
      
      *Q:* Do you consider whether a journal is OA when looking for reference materials?
      
      *A:* No.

    - "*Q:* Why do you publish?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *A:* Because I like to. It\xE2\x80\x99s fun. I think I got into this field originally\xE2\x80\xA6I actually used to be a musician. But I liked teaching so I thought that I liked this religious studies stuff so maybe I should try to get a degree, but the only place that you can teach that much is at universities on the east coast. I\xE2\x80\x99d have to get a Ph.D., so I went into grad school pretty much with the idea that I would teach and I had to have a PhD to teach and once you\xE2\x80\x99re in an academic situation, you have to publish. You know, \xE2\x80\x9CPublish or Perish.\xE2\x80\x9D I thought I\xE2\x80\x99d be doing the research more to support myself than teaching, but it actually flipped. After, especially even in grad school, I started realizing that I really liked the research. Then, writing my dissertation, I found that I really liked writing this big project. The more I did that, the more I\xE2\x80\x99ve actually found that I like teaching OK, but, y\xE2\x80\x99know, if someone offered me a job tomorrow at the Princeton Center for Advanced Studies, for example, where I didn\xE2\x80\x99t have to teach, or especially be on committees *blech!* and I could just research and write all the time, I think I\xE2\x80\x99d take them up on it at this point in my life. Unfortunately, no one offers you those kinds of jobs unless you\xE2\x80\x99re a scientist. So, I think the first thing is that\xE2\x80\x99s what I like to do: coming up with a problem and trying to solve the problem: reading a lot of stuff and searching through libraries and trying to figure out a coherent argument. I\xE2\x80\x99ve also found that I like the challenge of trying to write it well so that it\xE2\x80\x99s accessible to audiences. Clearly also, especially some things that I\xE2\x80\x99ve written which are intended for a wider audience, like the Sex and the Single Savior book or my Pedagogy of the Bible\xE2\x80\xA6those were because I want to change the world. The Sex and the Single Savior books were because I really don\xE2\x80\x99t like the way the Bible engages in discussions about gender and sexuality. The pedagogy was because I think that people who are being trained for the ministry aren\xE2\x80\x99t being trained properly. I thought that I had better ideas about this, so I\xE2\x80\x99ll try to change the tools. So, there is a part of wanting to get things out there. Also, I guess it\xE2\x80\x99s the fact that I\xE2\x80\x99m egotistical and the way you get out there and get respect as a scholar is publishing. If you don\xE2\x80\x99t publish, no one gets it. Now, talking about open access, I\xE2\x80\x99ve never been too worried about\xE2\x80\xA6because I haven\xE2\x80\x99t geared my writing/publishing to making money, like some of my friends had. Bart Ehrman is making a ton of money\xE2\x80\xA6he was just actually talking to me about it. There was this guy visiting a class a week ago or so and he was taking pictures and notes and he was a representative of one of those companies that videotapes professors and sells the tapes or discs or whatever and my friend Bart has done those. I said \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t know why I\xE2\x80\x99d be interested because the lectures that I had for Yale..they\xE2\x80\x99re gonna put those online for me. I don\xE2\x80\x99t know why some company would go and invest a bunch of money in those. I don\xE2\x80\x99t want to sit down and write a bunch of new lectures for this course; I don\xE2\x80\x99t really want to do that.\xE2\x80\x9D He wrote back and said \xE2\x80\x9CWell, I\xE2\x80\x99ve done one of those and I make between 50 and 60 thousand dollars a year doing that.\xE2\x80\x9D He said \xE2\x80\x9CYou might consider doing that.\xE2\x80\x9D Of course, his latest book has been on the bestseller book for weeks. He\xE2\x80\x99ll say \xE2\x80\x9CWhy don\xE2\x80\x99t you write a popular book? Do it with my publisher! \xE2\x80\x9D But, I just can\xE2\x80\x99t stand the thought of it. When I write stuff, I\xE2\x80\x99m interested in WHAT I\xE2\x80\x99m writing. I\xE2\x80\x99m interested in getting the ideas out there. Just writing to sell\xE2\x80\xA6it just doesn\xE2\x80\x99t appeal to me. So, what that means is that some people would not want their lectures put online for free because they feel it\xE2\x80\x99s their property and they\xE2\x80\x99re going to make money off of it some way. Or you know they\xE2\x80\x99ll actually write to make money. Since I don\xE2\x80\x99t do that, I\xE2\x80\x99ve never been concerned with people putting my books or my articles or things online so that anybody could use that for free. I\xE2\x80\x99m more concerned with getting my ideas out there than making money.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *A:* When you publish articles, how do you choose where to publish them?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *Q:* It depends a lot upon what the content of the article is and what I want to accomplish with it. I'm writing an article right now that is very focused on the question \"What are Angels and Demons in ancient Judaism and when did Angels become Demons?\" In ancient Christianity mythology, demons are fallen angels. This doesn't agree with Paul or with ancient Judaism, so I've been trying to figure out what's going on here. As in, when does this happen. Paul doesn't believe this, that demons are one kind of being and angels are another kind of being and they don't really cross paths much. When do they come together? I decided it was around the 2nd-3rd century in Christian mythology. I've done a bunch of presentations on this at various conferences and schools, and it involves comparing the translations of the Hebrew bible to the translations in the Greek or the Septuagint version. It's very technical. I'll probably send that to the Journal of Biblical literature, which is pretty much the flagship journal of biblical studies, probably internationally. Certainly in North America. That's because it's going to be a technical thing. I've published articles in more popular...well...maybe not \"popular.\" I had a piece that was invited...a lot of times when I publish articles it's because I'm invited to and people want me writing them for a series or a collection they're editing and publishing so it gets published like that. For example, the Anglican Theological review asked me to write a short essay on homosexuality in the bible for a collection of unpublished essays from this dead professor.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *Q:* Are you familiar with research repositories?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *A:* You mean online?...[discussion of repositories]...Oh. I've heard of that. There are a lot of professors opposed to that.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      I can see that people might have legitimate objections if it's a situation where it's depriving them of the opportunity to make money. For example, I know that there are scientists who are very opposed...there are some schools who force their scientists to co-ownership of patents and things like that. I can see why scientists would balk at things like that. Like I said, I've never made much money at all from all of my royalties. I've published five books of my own where I was the sole author and I've edited like three with other people, and per year, all I make on all the royalties on all the books...the most I've ever made was last year...$4,000 total. For years, I'd get maybe $600 total. That's what's more normal, especially for scholars in the humanities. You just don't get much, unless you publish really popular stuff. Unless it's the New York Times bestseller list or something, you really don't make much money. Literature, Religion, Classics, these subjects..more people buy our stuff because it has an audience of seminaries, divinity schools, churches. So, I'm always surprised when someone who publishes in Art History tells me what they make on royalties or even the number of books printed. It might only be 1,500 or 750 printed in the first printing, which for most books is the only one. I always thought that I sold very few but they come around in about 3,000 books per printing. A lot of people who are buying my books would't go out and buy an art history book. Most of us just think that we're not making that much money on books anyway.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *Q:* What if faculty were able to opt out of inclusion in a repository?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *A:* I think that if I had that option..hm..well, when people ask me if they can put up my talks online and let people see the written transcript, I always tell them yes.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *Q:* Are there OA journals focusing in religious studies?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *A:* I can't imagine that there wouldn't be. My grad students would know.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *Q:* How would you feel about an OA program at Yale?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *A:* I'd have no problem with it. I think the only people who might have a problem with it are those who stand to make a lot of money off of their work. Especially articles...I don't ever make any money off of articles!\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *Q:* Have you heard of the overpricetag project?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      *A:* That's the way they make their money...individuals used to subscribe to journals, but nowadays publishers rely on journals. They used to have an individual/library price for journals. Libraries went along with it for years because for a number of years, having those journals on hand was one of the only ways to maintain your reputation as a top research library. Now, libraries have stopped doing it..."

      *Q:* Why do you publish your research?
      
      *A:* Communicating with others is essential to the pursuit of truth. You have to allow your convictions to be challenged or confirmed by others, who are in a position to do so. (Many responses to my work have no interested me at all. ) There was the other and more prosaic reason: to make your way in academe you need to publish. That is no longer a matter of personal concern.
      
      *Q:* How do you choose where (in which journals) to publish your articles?
      
      *A:* I have not given the matter much thought. In the beginning of my career I tried to pick journals that seemed appropriate for a particular piece I had written. But I never allowed the preferences of particular journals or the then current academic fashion to dictate the direction of my work. In the last thirty years or so I have not published unsolicited pieces, except for my books.
      
      *Q:* Q. Are you familiar with the concept of Open Access? Are you familiar with University Open Access programs?
      
      *A:* Only vaguely. I think I am for it. The more open access, the better. I was thus pleased when the first third of a book I had written was put on the internet by someone in Israel, and without my permission; or when my book, The Meaning of Modern Art was published in a Korean translation, once again without my knowledge.
      
      For the rest of the questions, Open Access articles are defined as:
      
      1. Available to any reader to freely license or copy and to redistribute the article without limitations
      
      2. Available in an online repository that is free for anyone to access
      
      *Q:* What are your experiences involving OA? (Have you ever published material under OA?)
      
      No.
      
      *Q:* What is the state of Open Access at Yale as far as you know? Have you ever published something in an open access journal?
      
      *A:* I have not paid attention to it.
      
      *Q:* How would you feel about expanding the state of open access at Yale? What about requiring it?
      
      *A:* As I said before, the more open access, the better. But I would be against requiring it. There may well be good reasons why a certain essay should not be available to everyone -- although this is less likely to be the case in philosophy than in some other areas.
      
      *Q:* Would you consider publishing some of your future work OA? What kind of incentive would you need to publish in one?
      
      *A:* Since I believe that open access is a good idea, I would not need any special incentive, as long as I was sure that whatever essay or book was made available in that manner, was made available in a form that did justice to it. That can become especially important where there is a question of using visual material. That may, e. g., involve issues of quality of image and of copyright laws. A publisher, too, may insist on restrictions - and I still much prefer to read a book I can hold in my hand. In my case royalties have not been a very significant factor.
      
      *Q:* What are your concerns (or your peers' concerns) about an OA program?
      
      *A:* I have not really discussed it with anyone in any substantial way. What comment I have heard has been in favor of open access.
      
      *Q:* When you use/reference articles by other academics/your peers, do you ever access/use OA journals?
      
      *A:* I certainly have made references to material, including articles, I found on the internet, but I have paid no attention to whether something was published in an OA journal.
      
      *Q:* Do you consider whether a journal is OA when looking for reference materials?
      
      *A:* No

      *Q:* Why do you publish your research? (Distribution of knowledge? Citations? Tenure? Money?)
      
      *A:* There's no sense doing research if you don't let it out. The purpose is to advance the world. If you don't publish, there is no benefit to the world.
      
      *Q:* How do you choose where (in which journals) to publish your articles?
      
      *A:* One tries to get the maximum readership.
      
      *Q:* Are you familiar with the concept of Open Access?
      
      *A:* Yes.
      
      _Our working definition of Open Access at a university is:_
      
      _1. Available to any reader to freely license or copy and to redistribute the article without limitations_
      
      _2. Available in an online repository that is free for anyone to access_
      
      *Q:* What are your experiences involving OA? (Have you ever published material under OA?)
      
      *A:* I don't think any of my publications are officially open access, but they effectively are. Almost every scientist (that's who would read my stuff) has access to electronic copies of journals through their University libraries. Sometimes developing country people e-mail me and then I send them a PDF of the article.
      
      *Q:* What is the state of Open Access at Yale as far as you know? Have you ever published something in an open access journal?
      
      *A:* Yale is trying to digitize important parts of the library's holdings to make then available. Digitizing is slow and expensive, so this doesn't happen overnight.
      
      *Q:* How would you feel about expanding the state of open access at Yale? What about requiring it with a faculty-wide mandate similar to Harvard's or MIT's?
      
      *A:* Don't know anything about Harvard or MIT policy. Mandates are often bad - there are always reasonable exceptions to any rule and unintended consequences of the best plans (e.g. ethanol from corn). I don't think access is a problem for anyone in my field. There is much more published and available than anyone can read.
      
      *Q:* Would you consider publishing some of your future work OA? What kind of incentive would you need to publish in this manner?
      
      *A:* I have no problem with open access and wouldn't need an incentive.
      
      *Q:* What are your concerns (or your peers' concerns) about an OA program?
      
      *A:* If it's a 'mandate' then people will object. The only big problem is University libraries' budgets. Journals cost them a fortune. I doubt that the profit margins are very high (you ought to check that). Publishing can be expensive. Someone has to pay for it. Who do you suggest? OA may switch charges from libraries to authors (OA journals often charge the authors for publication). Is that an improvement?

      *Q:* How long have you been publishing?
      
      *A:* Since 1969.
      
      *Q:* Do you feel like the environment has changed a lot since then when it comes to journal articles?
      
      *A:* Yeah, the stakes are vastly higher now. The amount of work that gets put into each paper, at least in a leading journal is amazingly greater than it was in 1969. There's just so much you can learn so fast these days... things are moving so quickly that each article is a monumental piece of work. It's amazing. And many articles have lots of additional material that doesn't appear in the main part of the article; it goes into supplemental materials. They can frequently be five times as long as the main article and contain vast amounts of data that's in public databases and so on. Anyway, things have changed quite a bit. And this is in biological sciences. You should understand that the publishing habits have been different, and different parts of the academy vary tremendously. In biology, everybody's in a big rush, so there's a huge premium on getting your paper out first and getting your paper reviewed and edited and so on very quickly. In other fields, like philosophy, it might take years to get a paper reviewed and published... history, and other fields like that. So biology is operating on a different time scale than some other fields. And the volume of publications is phenomenally larger than in some other fields. Then there are other fields that move even faster, like physics, because they post a lot of their work as preprints on servers, so anybody can take a look at that before it's even reviewed or published in a journal. So that's often another extreme. So the philosophers are here, the physicists are here, and the biologists are somewhere in the middle. Okay?
      
      *Q:* Why do you publish your research?
      
      *A:* Why do we publish our research? Because that's the public record of what we've discovered and the currency for professional advancement and obtaining research funds because it's very expensive. To run my lab costs about over a million dollars a year... something like that. There are six or seven graduate students... six or seven post-docs... some undergrads, technicians, and so on. It's like running a small business; that's all funded by public funds. You have to have a record of accomplishment to justify somebody giving you that kind of money every year. And the publications are the public record.
      
      *Q:* So how do you choose which publications to publish in?
      
      *A:* That depends on the particular paper. Some papers are of greater general interest than others. And for papers that might have a wide audience, then you'd like to publish them in a journal that has a wide audience too. So some journals, like Science, where you read our paper, has two-hundred thousand subscribers, or something like that vast number... maybe it's one-hundred-fifty thousand; I can't remember. Some other journals may have no subscribers, other than libraries. So it's a huge difference in the number of people who will see a particular paper. And so, for something of general interest, like the paper you read, which was bringing together lots of biochemistry and cell biology and mathematical modeling... you know, something like that's considered to be a substantial advance in a field, and then you can compete for space in one of those high-profile journals. Now there's lots of other very good work that we publish that's progressively more specialized and so I'm pretty good about understanding ahead of time when we put a paper together where it would be appropriate to publish the work. Some people just try for the highest possible journal they could possibly get their paper in every time, and then when they get rejected there, they go and try something new that's more specialized, less competitive. I think that's a waste of time. After all these years, I pretty much know which kind of journal's going to be receptive to a particular paper and we can aim our papers to an appropriate journal.
      
      *Q:* So are you familiar with the concept of Open Access?
      
      *A:* Oh sure. Absolutely. I'm in leadership positions in scientific societies that worry about this all the time.
      
      *Q:* Do you have any experience involving Open Access?
      
      *A:* Oh sure, yeah. What do you want to know?
      
      *Q:* Have you ever published any material in Open Access journals?
      
      *A:* The journals vary in the extent to which they are open access. There are some journals, society journals, and [especially] the National Academy of Sciences, both of which I work for in an editorial capacity, who release their articles relatively soon after they've been published, after a month or so, or sometimes after a shorter delay. Then there are other journals that will release the content after a year, which is pretty much the standard these days. And it would be helpful if everybody released the content of their articles sooner than later. And Congress is interested in this, and they have passed legislation saying everybody whose work is supported by the National Institutes of Health has to put their papers when they're accepted on a website at the National Institutes of Health. And so on. So it's moving along in that direction. But the commercial publishers, and some of the scientific societies that publish journals are very nervous about open access. So let's see why they're so nervous about this. Some scientific societies' main source of revenue is the sales of their journal, and so they're concerned that if they release the content of their journal up front with no delay that they'd lose many of their individual subscribers and maybe some of their institutional subscribers and their scientific society would collapse financially. They're probably wrong, actually, because the American Society for Cell Biology, which publishes a journal called Molecular Biology of the Cell, has experimented with this, and I think (and I'm one of the editors, so I've got an interest in this) has experimented with how to maintain subscriptions and open the content to the general public, and I think we release things after two months now. And as we gradually scaled back the release date from a year to six months to two months, it actually increased the number of subscriptions. I don't know that anybody else has tried this experiment or not. I don't know what would happen had they scaled it back to zero months. But at the moment that's where that journal stands, and for virtually any purpose that I can imagine, a two month delay is not a big deal. So that's where things are going. Now there are some other journals that are completely open access and release their content immediately. Oh, I should say, some society journals release (like the Molecular Biology of the Cell and the Journal of Biological Chemistry), actually release a PDF file of the manuscript that will be published before they're edited (after they're reviewed), they release a PDF file of the manuscript on a website during the time that the manuscript's being processed and the publication's coming out and then after two months they release the final, edited, formated, perfect paper. And so those society journals are actually completely open in that sense, that you can see the content of the article. Doesn't look as nice as the finished product where it's all perfect. Anyway, so they're pretty much open from the beginning even though they have a two month delay from their official publication release. Okay. Then there are some journals that are completely open access that release their content right away, and their business model involves the authors paying a fairly large fee to publish the article because it actually costs money to review and edit and publish even if it's electronic papers, so it's a fairly sizable amount of money... A few thousand dollars, something like that. And, you know, that's fine. They actually need more money than the money they can collect from the authors so that the main open access journals actually have philanthropic sources of funding that are probably going to go away at some point. They were instituted just to allow the open access movement to get going and probably won't be maintained, so I don't know what's going to happen to those journals when their philanthropy goes away. So, anyway, it's virtuous to release everything right away, but actually it's financially a bit of a challenge, and for some societies, it's actually self-threatening that they don't have a very good open access policy. For the commercial publishers, they're all scared to death that they're going to lose their business and, so, they have a delay before they release their content. It turns out, if you look at the number of downloads of articles, that the peak is right at the beginning... The first week, the first month, then it gradually trails off. And depending on the quality and interest of the article, then there's some sort of steady state number of downloads you get, and the people who are worried about their business going away take a look at those curves and say, okay, there's a high level of demand for a month or so, and so we can afford to release after two months or after a year when the demand's gone down. Because of that demand up front, they don't think they can release right away because they'll lose their paying customers.
      
      *Q:* What is the state of open access at Yale? What is the general sentiment towards it?
      
      *A:* I'm not sure there is a Yale opinion about open access. You can ask as many faculty members as you'd like, and they'd probably all have similar but certainly not a uniform opinion about the whole thing. I don't see that many people in our department here publishing in the pure open access journals, but I'm sure that's going to change. I have two children up there in that family picture; they're both young scientists, and they almost always publish in the completely open access journals. That's just something that younger scientists think is an appropriate thing to do, and the older people have been publishing in the same journals as always; they know their readers are there, but they've got a whole new set of readers in the fields that they're in, and so they're fine. They publish in the open access journal.
      
      *Q:* How do you feel about expanding the open access policy at Yale? Something like Harvard's where all faculty members are required to grant Harvard a license that allows them to put it online in an online depository?
      
      *A:* Well for biologists, that already happens. NIH does that already. I don't know how the people in other fields would react to that. Biologists are already used to that. Okay?
      
      *Q:* So you would be fine with something like that?
      
      *A:* Well, I mean theoretically all the preprints go to the NIH, and actually the commercial publishers are very good about this. They know they're supposed to do this, so they actually send the preprints to the NIH. I've got four of them waiting there in line; I've got to approve their submission to the NIH. I've been too busy teaching cell biology to go to the website and say it's okay for you guys to put this thing on your website before the paper comes out. The other journals I publish in are pretty good about releasing their content right away, so, like I said, I don't think a two month delay is material, because it isn't going to change anybody's life. The work usually took years to accomplish, and it took months or years to get the paper written and published, so what's another two months before the journal releases it to the public? So, I don't think it's a big deal. It's a little deal.
      
      *Q:* Do you feel like there are any benefits of open access?
      
      *A:* Oh sure, yeah. I mean, there are plenty of places in the world where there are no libraries, and there's no way to get your hands on the literature, whether it's in science or it's in other fields, so its great for the parts of the world that don't have the university library. We're all spoiled here. We can log on to essentially anything that's published in the world from home or anywhere else on earth by just logging in through Yale. And so Yale has to pay big bucks to the publishers to have access to all those things. I don't know who [isn't able to] understand, this is actually a scary aspect of the whole thing, that those electronic files are not in the Yale library, even through we're paying money for it. Those files are someplace else, so if... Most responsible people have them very well backed up in multiple places, but if a publisher went out of business and said to hell with it, they weren't going to maintain their files, you could lose all this stuff, so the library is scared to death about this, so they actually have paper copies of all the journals because we know that'll last for hundreds of years. And it'd be different if the library actually had the digital files of all these journals, but they don't, so when you log into the library and you download a paper from Science or the New England Journal of Medicine like I did last night to do this thing for class today, the paper isn't here. The paper's in Boston or in London or someplace... the electronic files in London or Boston or someplace... it's not here. And it's just a link through to the journal server. It's pretty weird. So they're paying thousands of bucks a year for access to the server and counting on somebody else to archive this stuff. That's a strange thing about electronic publishing. But anyway, that's how it goes.
      
      *Q:* What do you feel like professors here... What do you feel like their chief concern about open access is? Not the publishers, but the actual professors.
      
      *A:* Oh, the only concern... I don't think anybody has any concern about access to the material... the only concern that anybody has here... or at least, it seems to me... is publishing in a startup journal that doesn't have a track record. So the open access journals were invented in the past ten years, and they don't have a track record, or they're just developing a track record, and some of them are doing pretty well, some of them are not doing pretty well; whereas, something like the Journal of Cell Biology or Science or Nature... those have been around for a long time. A hundred and fifty years in the case of Science and Nature. Decades... half a century in the case of the Journal of Cell Biology. So those are well established, prestigious places to publish work. You don't just want to publish work; you want to publish work in a high-quality journal. That doesn't mean there isn't high quality work in the not-so-good journals, but there's a lot of important prestige connected with publishing in good journals. For example, it doesn't make too much difference to me, I mean, I'm a well established person here. But for a young person like yourself, it would actually be a huge benefit for you to get a research publication in one of these top journals. That would mark you as somebody who could do that quality of work and would improve your chances of getting into medical school, if that's where you're headed, or getting into business school, if that's where you're headed, or getting into graduate school and having a faculty position, getting a grant, all those things. When people look at somebody's track record, they say, oh, look he published in this journal, in that journal, and other things... they might not know the exact details, but they'll just read down the list and see where the papers are published. And for young people like my kids, who are in their thirties, those people read down the list and they find all these open access journals and say, that's cool, this person's with it, they're publishing in open access journals. But for people who are even ten years older than them, who established themselves before the open access journals came along, they're much more reluctant to publish in those journals.
      
      *Q:* It's the journal itself that people look at?
      
      *A:* Yep.
      
      *Q:* Not the number of citations, or...
      
      *A:* Well, yeah, well, the number of citations go along with that. So the prestige journals all have very high citation rates.
      
      *Q:* Interesting. Do you see the future as being....
      
      *A:* It'll evolve. I mean, there were some journals in the biochemistry area that were prominent, favorite places to publish work forty years ago that are pretty much disappeared. They're still publishing, but it's third-rate material. So the quality of these journals is not constant over time; it can go up, or it can go down. And the top journals spent an enormous amount of time and effort making sure they stay on top. So I'm on the board of directors of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which publishes Science, which is the number one journal in the world, and they spend an enormous amount of time and effort making sure that they stay number one. It's a very competitive business. They're always looking over their shoulder at Nature, trying to stay one step ahead of them. I don't know whether this happens in the non-scientific fields, I just don't know anything about it. I have a brother who's a philosophy professor, and my impression is that in that area of academic activity it's completely different. I'm sure there's a pecking order for the journals there, but they're all small operations, and they move slowly. I'm sure it's important to the people in the field, but it's not a fifty million dollar business like Science magazine is. That little Science magazine comes out... costs a million dollars a week to produce. Ha!

      *Q:* Why do you publish your research?
      
      *A:* Because I am a scholar, because scholarship is a collective activity with public responsibilities, because I like to share ideas.
      
      *Q:* How do you choose where (in which journals) to publish your articles?
      
      *A:* Journals select me as often as I selected journals, in that editors are seeking articles in special issues or seeking coverage of particular topics that happen to be those in which I am working. When I select a journal as a venue, is because I think it its readership will provide the most challenging and interested audience for my ideas. My choice does not depend on my calculation of the Journal's access.
      
      *Q:* Are you familiar with the concept of Open Access? Are you familiar with University Open Access programs?
      
      *A:* I am familiar with the concept, and I know that the University has encouraged it through various programs. However, I do not know the details of the university programs.
      
      _For the rest of the questions, Open Access articles are defined as:_
      
      _1. Available to any reader to freely license or copy and to redistribute the article without limitations_
      
      _2. Available in an online repository that is free for anyone to access_
      
      *Q:* What are your experiences involving OA? (Have you ever published material under OA?)
      
      *A:* I maintain and offer PDF copies of every book, article, and review I have written at my personal Yale website. All of my courses have websites that are open to the world, with only copyrighted material of others (readings, images, streaming video) limited to Yale students in courses. I realize that in some cases my legal authority to do so is shaky and may be challenged, but so far I have never been questioned or forced to take down any of my publications.
      
      *Q:* What is the state of Open Access at Yale as far as you know? Have you ever published something in an open access journal?
      
      *A:* I don't know if the journals I have published in are formally open access, but many are available online for free through JSTOR.
      
      *Q:* How would you feel about expanding the state of open access at Yale? What about requiring it?
      
      *A:* In principle, I think it is a good idea. I'm not sure if it should be required for all disciplines and all scholars
      
      *Q:* Would you consider publishing some of your future work OA? What kind of incentive would you need to publish in one?
      
      *A:* I don't publish for money so the issue of royalties is not important to me personally. I am concerned about intellectual property rights, especially for junior scholars, and I am not persuaded that Creative Commons License offers much protection.
      
      *Q:* When you use/reference articles by other academics/your peers, do you ever access/use OA journals?
      
      *A:* Yes.
      
      *Q:* Do you consider whether a journal is OA when looking for reference materials?
      
      *A:* No.

      *Q:* Why do you publish your research?
      
      *A:* If I am funded to do research, then it is my obligation to make the results available to the community. Why light a candle and hide it under a bucket?
      
      *Q:* How do you choose where (in which journals) to publish your articles?
      
      *A:* I choose the journal most appropriate for the research, i.e. one that publishes research in my field.
      
      *Q:* Are you familiar with the concept of Open Access? Are you familiar with University Open Access programs?
      
      *A:* No.

      *A:* No.
      
      *Q:* What is the state of Open Access at Yale as far as you know? Have you ever published something in an open access journal?
      
      *A:* Probably not.
      
      *Q:* How would you feel about expanding the state of open access at Yale? What about requiring it?
      
      *A:* I have no problems with open access, but I can imagine some problems with maintaining quality control, i.e. having all articles refereed.
      
      *Q:* Would you consider publishing some of your future work OA? What kind of incentive would you need to publish in one?
      
      *A:* I will continue to publish in the journal most appropriate for my research.
      
      *Q:* What are your concerns (or your peers' concerns) about an OA program?
      
      *A:* Maintaining quality control and responsible refereeing.
      
      *Q:* When you use/reference articles by other academics/your peers, do you ever access/use OA journals?
      
      *A:* I do not know.
      
      *Q:* Do you consider whether a journal is OA when looking for reference materials?
      
      *A:* No.

    - Welcome to OA @ Yale!
    - "Here's our site! This space is meant to display the information we've gathered about the state of Open Access here, and how efforts are proceeding to increase the availability of research and writing by Yale's faculty. We've also got a small news blog, and this is the inaugural post. So look around! We hope you appreciate the information.

      Hey everybody!  Just to let you know, things are exciting around here.  We got linked by "Peter Suber":http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/fosblog.html, which is pretty crazy, and we've been getting a lot of hits on the site.  Which is actually a little embarrassing, frankly, since I haven't had the domain pointing properly.  But that's just lent urgency to my work, which has been revising the site and improving the quality of the code.  The backend is a lot more robust now, with fully editable pages, and earlier this evening I reconfigured the server and fixed the domain problem.  
      
      Keep an eye out, because I'll have new site improvements in the works (my next dev goals include more pretty pictures and blog comments!) and we'll be continually updating and improving the quality of our content.  And you can expect us to get some more data, too!

    - "h1. Open Access at Yale\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Yale University has produced some of the greatest, most important, most groundbreaking research for hundreds of years. And beyond research, the university prides itself on being philanthropic and caring for humanity at large. Despite both of these well-established facts, there have been no significant efforts to implement an Open Access policy at Yale.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      In Yale's \"faculty handbook\":http://www.yale.edu/provost/handbook/handbook_x__university_policies_concerni.html#T3, it states:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      bq. _The University does not conduct or permit its faculty to conduct secret or classified research. This policy arises from concern about the impact of such restrictions on two of the University\xE2\x80\x99s essential purposes:  to impart knowledge and to enlarge humanity\xE2\x80\x99s store of knowledge. Both are clearly inhibited when open publication, free discussion, or access to research are limited._ (X.B.1.b.)\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Clearly, the \"essential purposes\" of Yale are not being fulfilled.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Nabiha Syed, a student at Yale Law School, began working on implementing an Open Access program at YLS. However, complications arose. One of the major problems is consciousness of OA, of which there seems to be none. Another problem was that a new law school dean needs to be found before any progress or actions could be made. When the new dean is chosen, Syed plans to bring the plan back to the table and hold a faculty vote. She also plans on getting the opinion of the editors-in-chief of various law school journals.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Jason Eiseman, the Librarian for Emerging Technologies at Yale Law School, pointed to a few technologies that Yale is toying with, but admitted that there was no real effort towards Open Access. One example is \"CONTENTdm\":http://digitalbkp.library.yale.edu/index.php, a digital collection management software. Yale Library has started putting up certain texts, images, and archives of the Yale Daily News. One of the problems the library has run into is metatagging and making the items searchable.</p>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Yet, however much actions like CONTENTdm are opening up Yale's resources, they are not Open Access when it comes to the stuff coming out of our departments every day. Much of scholarly research done by people at Yale is held under permission-and-fee. Only the scientists whose research is funded by the National Institutes of Health have an incentive (in the form of NIH requirements) to make their research free and open to any and all."

      h1. Open Access Beyond Yale
      
      In examining the current state of Open Access at places other than Yale one must consider what is being examined; there exist different metrics to judge by.
      
      * Open Access repositories
      * Institutional Open Access repositories
      * Institutional Policies for Open Access
      
      The first metric looks at how many instances of various Open Access software are running.  "OpenDOAR":http://www.opendoar.org, run by the University of Nottingham keeps track of this for repositories which are compliant with the "Open Archives Initiative":http://www.openarchives.org specifications, which exist to ensure interoperability in machine access methods between the growing numbers of repositories. OpenDOAR provides a good amount of data, if this is the metric that is most interesting. For example a breakdown of the repositories by location is provided in the following graph.
      
      !http://www.opendoar.org/charts.php?groupby=c.cCountry&orderby=Tally%20DESC%20&charttype=pie&width=600&height=300&caption=Proportion%20of%20Repositories%20by%20Country%20-%20Worldwide!
      
      Institutional Open Access repositories are a simply a subset of Open Access repositories with the somewhat arbitrary property that they are run by the institution for the purpose of archiving the results produced by that institution. Under this definition "Arxiv":http://www.arxive.org would not be an institutional repository despite being run by Cornell because it is a general repository rather than being directed specifically at the research output of Cornell. This metric is considered not to denigrate the contribution of other repositories, but rather because it provides a way to evaluate the effort of an institution towards Open Access. Furthermore an institutional archive makes it somewhat easier for an organization to determine if works that should be archived are in fact being archived by virtue of being centralized. The institutional repository of the National Institutes for Health (NIH), "PubMed Central":http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov is probably one of the best known examples of such a repository.
      
      Institutional Policies for Open Access are the institutions which have a policy relating to Open Access. Within this category there are some subcategories based on at what level the policy takes place. Those like that of the NIH which issue from those that fund the affected research are known, following the terminology of "ROARMAP":http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup, as _funder-mandates_.  If an organization that funds a significant amount of research adopts such a policy, it can have a wide ranging effect on the availability of research in the funded field. The second type is, following the same terminology, simply an _institutional-mandate_.   This sort of mandate covers those who work at a particular institution; if for example Yale were to adopt a "proposal":proposal as a policy, then it would be an institutional mandate affecting the faculty at Yale. The remaining type is a _departmental-mandate_, which affects only the members of a particular department, for example "the mandate passed by the Library Faculty at Oregon State University":http://www.uoregon.edu/~jqj/lib-deposit-faq.html.  It is important to note that policies vary substantially, and even a policy disapproving of Open Access would count as an Open Access policy, but it is not believed that there are any of this nature.
      
      Of the 119 policies not categorized as proposed, which may include some that are in preliminary stages but not categorized, the United States has 16, of these 11 are at Universities, and of these 3 of these are at Harvard.
      
      The schools with policies are as follows:
      * "Case Western Reserve":http://www.case.edu/president/facsen/frames/committees/library/LibraryComReport.pdf urges faculty to archive, but does not appear to have an institutional archive.
      * "Cornell":http://www.library.cornell.edu/scholarlycomm/resolution.html strongly urges the same, but has its own institutional archive, and runs Arxiv.org.
      * "Temple University":http://blog.library.temple.edu/liblog/archives/2008/12/temple-librarie.html appears to require archiving only for Master's and PHD dissertations rather than the output of faculty.
      * "MIT":http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/03/mit-adopts-university-wide-oa-mandate.html requires with an optout that faculty make their work available for deposit in the institutional archive.
      * "Harvard's":http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/OpenAccess/policytexts.php three policies for different schools are requirements to deposit in the institutional repository with an optout; however, Harvard College's repository is currently Harvard only, which is not in the spirit of Open Access.
      * "Oregon State University's":http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/jspui/bitstream/1957/10850/1/LFA%20Open%20Access%20Mandate.pdf Library Faculty passed a requirement to deposit with an optout.
      * "Stanford School of Education":http://ed.stanford.edu/suse/faculty/openaccess.html requires deposit with an output.
      * "Yale":proposal is notably missing from this list.
      
      The difference in the strength of these policies is clear. Looking at those that apply to faculty (excluding Temple University) there are two types of policies, those encouraging or suggesting deposit or investigating Open Access, and those requiring making available for deposit. These two types of policies were passed in groups. The weaker group of policies were passed in 2005, whereas the stronger group of policies were passed in 2008 and later with the resolutions adopting the policies generally citing the recently passed Harvard policy, and it is this latter type of policy that <a href="proposal">Yale</a> should adopt.

      \r\n\
      In a major university setting, professors conduct research, compile their findings, and submit peer-reviewed reports of their work to academic journals.  Many journals that publish these articles are \xE2\x80\x9Cclosed,\xE2\x80\x9D so that only subscription holders can access their contents.  Annual subscription fees greatly limit readership, with some price tags demanding over $20,000 per year.  Numerous online scholarly journals lower the cost barrier slightly, charging a fee for access to individual articles. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      This system is intrinsically flawed.  Authors usually retain the right to distribute copies, so why should access be limited to those who pay middlemen access?  This favors students and researchers at wealthy universities over students and researchers at schools with fewer financial resources, but not even wealthy institutions are able to subscribe to all publications.  Moreover, limiting information access conflicts with the role of universities in modern society.  As teaching institutions engaged in research, universities exist to educate students and to broaden the scope of human knowledge; restricting the availability of new ideas through closed access journals contravenes these goals.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Yale University\xE2\x80\x99s faculty handbook states:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      bq. _\"The University does not conduct or permit its faculty to conduct secret or classified research. This policy arises from concern about the impact of such restrictions on two of the University\xE2\x80\x99s essential purposes:  to impart knowledge and to enlarge humanity\xE2\x80\x99s store of knowledge. Both are clearly inhibited when open publication, free discussion, or access to research are limited\"_ (X.B.1.b.)\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Despite these words, Yale does not have a proper policy set in place to carry out its own mission.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      h2. Open Access\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Open Access repositories have been established in more than 35 schools worldwide to help advance the goals of academic research.  These repositories compile pre- or post-print electronic copies of professors\xE2\x80\x99 articles in a free, unrestricted collection online, and make them available to anyone in the world.  Without the cost barriers of subscription, pay-per-view fees, or the permission barriers of licensing and copyright restrictions, information is more easily and quickly propagated. This allows for:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      * Better education, worldwide. Under this system, students from all around the world have free, Open Access to top scholarly research for use in the classroom, for research purposes, or even for personal use. Opening access through new technologies helps to expand the learning environment for everybody.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      * Increased access to research, not only for other students, but also for other scholars, patients, and citizens. This helps keep the population informed and leads to smarter decision making - whether personal, communal, or global - in our future.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      * Progress in research, greater visibility, and a higher impact. Researchers have greater access to cutting-edge work through the power of new technologies. Studies have shown that Open Access leads to a higher number of citations for articles. Also, with unfettered access to the work, Open Access only increases the effects that articles have on the world at large.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      We, the undersigned students, hereby propose the following Open Access repository program, based upon the existing policies at Harvard, MIT, and Stanford:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      In order to properly carry out its commitment to impart knowledge and enlarge humanity\xE2\x80\x99s store of knowledge, the Faculty of Yale University will actively seek to embrace new technologies to increase access to its work among the human population. Each Faculty member grants to the President and Fellows of the institution permission to make available his or her scholarly articles and to exercise the copyright in those articles. In legal terms, the permission granted by each Faculty member is a nonexclusive, irrevocable, paid-up, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of his or her scholarly articles, in any medium, and to authorize others to do the same, provided that the articles are not sold for a profit. The policy will apply to all scholarly articles written while the author is a member of the Faculty except for any articles completed before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the Faculty member entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy. The Provost or the Provost\xE2\x80\x99s designate will waive application of the policy for a particular article upon written request by a Faculty member explaining the need.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      To assist the University in distributing the articles, each Faculty member will provide an electronic copy of the final version of the article at no charge to the appropriate representative of the Provost\xE2\x80\x99s Office in an appropriate format (such as PDF) specified by the Provost\xE2\x80\x99s Office.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The Provost\xE2\x80\x99s Office may make the article available to the public in an open-access repository. The Office of the Provost will be responsible for interpreting this policy, resolving disputes concerning its interpretation and application, and recommending changes to the Faculty from time to time.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The policy is to take effect immediately; it will be reviewed by the Provost\xE2\x80\x99s Office through the Office of Digital Assets and Infrastructure Advisory Committee after three years, with a report presented to the Faculty.\r\n\

      The Public Library of Science (PLoS) is a nonprofit devoted to encouraging open access publishing for scientific and medical resources.  Upon its founding, PLoS attempted to persuade existing scientific publishers to make research literature freely available online.  They drafted a letter signed by nearly 34,000 scientists from 180 different countries, but despite such a huge swell of support, received a disappointing response.  PLoS responded by founding their own publishing venture.  PLoS now has seven peer-reviewed journals in major scientific fields.  (Point of interest: PLoS originally designed the open-lock Open Access logo, which was adapted for this site).\r\n\
